## Hello World!

This is a test to figure out just exactly how to get jekyll to build a page on Github pages, and to do it right!  Right now the page is accessible but there's no styling to it.  I'm gonna try and create another jekyll post and see what that looks like.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
